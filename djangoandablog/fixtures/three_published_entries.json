        "content": "Hey everyone, I have recently received a heart felt letter from a Nigerian prince. The letter contained a plea for monetary help in claiming his late father's throne from his estranged brother. Included was a promise that I will receive a large amount of money in thanks once the throne is secure. Not only did I immediately send him the required funds but I have also decided to liquidate my assets in order to travel to Nigeria so that I may personally assist with the succession.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I fear I won't have time for this blog any more. I wish you all the best of luck. ",
